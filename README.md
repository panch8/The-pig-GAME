Project that implements HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

another step on my coding learning journey. 

Game RULES:

A 2 player game were a dice is rolled, On each turn the players will try to achieve the final goal of accumulating 100 points. 

The active player can roll the dice as long as he wants accumulating the value of the dices he gets, only when the save button is pressed, the points are actually saved, this action will lead in changing the active player. If the value of the dice is = 1 the points accumulated are lost and the active player is changed.

ENJOY =)
